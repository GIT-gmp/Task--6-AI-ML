# Task--6-AI-ML 
Data Loading: The Iris dataset is loaded from a URL.
Preprocessing: The species labels are encoded, and features are normalized using StandardScaler.
Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
KNN Implementation: The KNN classifier is trained for different values of K, and accuracy is calculated.
Evaluation: Confusion matrices are displayed for each K value.
Visualization: The accuracy for different K values is plotted, and decision boundaries are visualized for the first two features.
